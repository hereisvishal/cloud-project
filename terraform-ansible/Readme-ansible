####apache.yml is the main configuration file and has been kept as simple as it could be####

###Has been tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (HVM), SSD Volume Type free tier AWS image - ami-0874ff0d73a3ab8cf (64-bit (x86)) / ami-0f58f0da665c8221f (64-bit (Arm)), Amazon Linux 2023 AMI ami-0a79730daaf45078a (64-bit (x86)) / ami-0fbdd26eea4b9e44e (64-bit (Arm)), Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) - Kernel 5.10, SSD Volume Type - ami-08fdff97845b0d82e (64-bit (x86)) / ami-0e795bc037fe26f3f (64-bit (Arm)).

->Should work on most RHEL-like" OSs

###Invnetory file uses the key pair for authentication. This should come from EC2 instances created on AWS###

 
#########

Important thing to remember before executing the playbook is that since default user on EC2-instance is "ec2-user", we need to specify the "-u" flag. The full usage would look like:

ansible-playbook -i inventory apache.yml -u ec2-user

You can disable host key checking to eleminate human intervention(assuming that first thing you want is to run this playbook after creation of the server).  Please note that this isn't a good practice security-wise. However, if you still want to do this, it can be achieved in a number of ways:

ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable if set)

ansible.cfg (in the current directory)

~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

Ansible host key checking needs to be turned to disabled for this.

Ex: Inside ansible.cfg, insert
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
